Upgrade of the pipeline: set a threshold parameter in the assignment to avoid outliers to be assigned. I added a thresh parameter (default 50) to say that if the computed distance is larger than that it will be replaced by a big number "1000" in that case (could be a variable) to avoid the points to be assigned. 

To estimate the performance I compared the results with hand computed points:

This operation removed 50 pixels  in errror.

Plotting the results and correcting the trajectory. Some problems in the segmentation of the wound: it is not present at all frames (no idea why) To be able to perform the analysis I modified the dataframe by adding rows where the wound was not segmented. For every plane that was not present I added in the dataframe the value of the previous time point (previous row). The rationale is that the frames that were not detected were not a lot consecutive and thus the interpolation that between 2 frames the wound don't change might be accurate.

I then plotted the area of the organism/area of thee wound (% of area occupied by the wound).

Then I corrected the trajectory and plotted the result

![[correct_traj.png]]  

Then I computed thee MSD with and without the correction.
With correction

Without:

The pipeline allowed to see the wound 24.60 % more

## Meeting with Léo:


- Interpolation: degré 3. (X)
- Correction avec données à la main. trajectoire (X)
- correction avec fenêtre glissante pour remove les plans abérrants (X)
- colorer par deplacement pour voir les moment de drift sur trajectoire (X) 
- connecter scatterplot et mettre des points spéciaux pour le début et la fin (X)
- A voir signe de l'erreur quand on compute la cummulative error (X)

## Automatic interpolation

![[interpolation_compare_wound.png]]

I interpolated the wound area using scipy  [InterpolatedUnivariateSpline](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.InterpolatedUnivariateSpline.html) function. We see that the interpolation is way better and will thus be used in the pipeline. 

## Plot the trajectory colored by the displacement

In order to do this I did:
- Correct dataframe with drift (coordinates)
- Compute the displacement (ie: eucledian distance) between frame t-1 and t 
- crop the dataframe for better visualization
- Normalize by the maximum displacement in the croped dataframe
- Plot the trajectory colored by the normalized dispalcement (color between 0 and 1)

![[correct_traj_norm.png]]

In order to have a better plot to show I also computed the ideal case. That is, compute the real drift manually between the frames detected by the pipeline and correct the dataframe using this computed distance. Then I plotted the trajectory using the same workflow as above.

![[correct_traj_norm_comp.png]]

We see that the correction lies between the uncorrected and the manual correction which means there is improvement to do. However we see that the correction lead to a smoothing of the movement (in the middle of the plot).

## Cumulated error V2

To compute a precise cumulated error I kept the sign of the error (i.e if the pipeline over or under estimate the drift) and plotted the cummulative drift.

![[drift_measurement_error_thresholded_cumulated.png]]

We see that the pipeline kind of correct itself and thus leads to a cummulated error smaller than before. 

# Thursday 01/12/2022

Exporting all the movies in tiff and running the pipeline to extract some plots. I found a mistake in the pipeline and corrected it. 

# Friday 02/12/2022

Test of the pipeline on new movies: 

![[placozoa_tracking/data/results/figures/complete_pipeline/correction.png]]

There are a lot of spikes that come form the segmentation and the correction isn't very robust.
