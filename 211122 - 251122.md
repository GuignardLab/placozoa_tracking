I realized that I didn't need to have a first segmentation in the pipeline for it to work. Because the mask is the image of the algae.

I will start compiling the functions that I have to have a cleaner notebook for the analysis. 

A compiled version of all the functions I created so far can be found under the name pipeline.py

I readjusted all the function so that they work together and in order to have a full working and easy to use pipeline.

the complete pipeline takes around 7 to 10 minutes to complete for 1000 frames which you need to add another 15 minutes of segmentation before the analysis.

A script to run the pipeline can be found under the name **pipeline.ipynb**

Ideas:
- I need quantitative measures for the segmentation:
	- I can use the jaccard index with the image I handly annotated ...
	- I can also define a roughness measure of the contour
	- The time the program could segment the wound 
	- The smoothness of the measurement ? 
	- compute signal to noise ratio
- I need to find a way to make the segmentation easy

## Meeting with Léo

- calcluer similarité d'image au lieu de distance. Creer bounding box pour chaque object segmenté, faire ca pour toutes les algues (placer la bb au centre de l'algue) recuperer cette slice sur l'image brute pour calculer similarité. 
- Segmentation algue
- Calculer score similarité entre algue segmenté
- appariment 
- fractality: inverse of smoothness as a measure of improvement
- Compute sphericity
- Une mesure de l'erreur de la pipeline pourrait être de prendre la trajectoire et de la modifier avec l'output de la pipeline et de ce que j'ai calculé à la main. 

## I tested the performance of the pipeline

Here we see the segmentation of the wound. What we see is that we are able to segment it for a longer time, which could be a measure of the performance of the pipeline. We can also look at the roughness of the sphere: the sphericity which could be an indicator of the segmentation. We could also look at the decrease of the perimeter.

## Meeting Léo 

- Enhancement of the processing time of the drift computation pipeline. Put everything in numpy arrays (much faster computation)
- For the image similarity, for the points that we can't take because they are too close to the edge: remove them...
