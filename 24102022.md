Try the histogram equalization again

The problem was that the saving of the image in an array that didn't work. Instead I created a list and made a list of list and saved it... 

Segment and plot the results: 

![[placozoa_tracking/data/results/figures/compare/auto_contrast/all_features_contrast.png]]

We can see that thee results are comparable with the one obtained by hand. Knowing that this step is automatic we can implement it directly. I don't know how to differentiate between contrast equalization and stretching. Stretching might be the easiest to justify and to grasp knowing the performance is relatively the same... 

Links for the explaination of the operation :
- [ Equalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_equalization)
- [Contrast stretching](http://what-when-how.com/embedded-image-processing-on-the-tms320c6000-dsp/contrast-stretching-image-processing/)

The flickering in the results might be due to the fact that the movies are the ones with the removed algae which introduce a lot of 0 in the image. When the contrast is changed this presence of 0s might bias the process. I could try to replace the value of the algae by something closer to background value. But in that case the question is then how to chose this background value...

Let's try by adjusting the value of the removed algae by hand:

We see an improvement in the segmentation with the filled image (looking at the blue curve against the red one) especially in the perimeter. That is maybe because the difference of contrast was less and thus after enhancement it became better. 

Plotting the 2 methods:

## Things to do:

- Drift correction
- Train the network (cluster lis that works ...)
- segment using CNN
- Preprocess new movies and segment them

### Team meeting: code review 

use set instead of list when you dont care about order. Can do operation ore easily on sets. The processing time increases logarithmically with the size in lists it is linearly.  A set cannot have repeated elements.
