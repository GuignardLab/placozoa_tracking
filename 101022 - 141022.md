## Week of the 14th of october 2022: Placozoa tracking

The goal of the internship is to track and segment Placozoa from bright field microscopy images.

# 12/10/2022: Running the Hackathon scripts

Running the scripts that can be found in:

```

- Ran the OTSU and CHAN VESE segmentation on 2 different movies: 
	- **'tricho_8' for 8 bits** 
	- **'tricho_wound that is the whole movie with wound at frame 19**

Observed difference between the 2 methods by eye: 
#### Otsu

#### Chan Vese
![[placozoa_tracking/data/results/figures/chanvese/all_features.png]]

There are spikes in the area notably because the object is at the border and thus the border is also segmented. 
The hole was not segmented:
	- Probably because of lack of contrast (maybe preprocess the image)
	- decrease the blur of the gaussian filter that decreases it

## Wound movie
Plots only for Chan Vese method:

![[placozoa_tracking/data/results/figures/chanvese/wound_movie/trichoplax_area_time.png]]
The drops are because for some frames the whole image is segmented (don't know why).
Here also the hole is not found (sometimes it is, hence the local minima I guess)

I also plotted the trajectory: 

![[placozoa_tracking/data/results/figures/chanvese/wound_movie/trajectory.png]]
From this I extracted the position and computed the MSD and plotted it against time

![[placozoa_tracking/data/results/figures/chanvese/wound_movie/MSD.png]]
Again the spikes are there but the type of diffusion looks to be confined as the MSD plateaux around 100 µm²

## Contrast enhancement in Fiji

Trying the contrast enhancement to see improvement in the segmentation. I used ImageJ to imrove the contrast and tried to segment using Chan Vese algorithm (deals better with object being in the corner while still being fast ish...) 

![[placozoa_tracking/data/results/figures/chanvese/contrast/trichoplax_area_time.png]]
No "flicks" in this plot, however there is a decrease in the are that I am inerested in.

Tried the trajectory as well: 
![[placozoa_tracking/data/results/figures/chanvese/contrast/trajectory.png]]
Looks less confined, MSD: 
![[placozoa_tracking/data/results/figures/chanvese/contrast/MSD.png]]
Looks more like a diffusion (random walk). It is very interesting that the animal seems to have different mechanisms of diffusion. Might be cool to try to fit the data with theoretical models of diffusion: 

$$ Brownian : \; <r^2> \; =  2D\tau $$
$$ Confined: \; <r^2> \; = \; \frac{L^2}{3}(1-\exp(\frac{-12D\tau}{L^2})) $$
With D: diffusion coefficient, $\tau$ the diffusion time, L the confinement diameter 

Going back to the area I wanted to plot side to side the area evolution and the image to see if the decreasing trend is conserved: 

![[mygif_compressed.gif]]

The quality can be improved (but it makes a bigger file ... )

We see that the organism shrinks i.e converges on itself for some reason: 
- Maybe to get food 
- Also the movement is circular in the begining not uniform 
- might be good to try the cell flow with this

Also from this movie we can extract the wound (it is able to segment it):

![[placozoa_tracking/data/results/figures/chanvese/contrast/wound_area_time.png]]
However it is only present for a few because the segmentation dosen't detect it everytime. Also it decreases because the animal seems to turn on itself thus "hiding" the wound in the 2D projection.

We can see that when we plot the trajectory: 
![[trajectory_wound.png]]
We see that there are spots all over because the wound disapear and reapears. Another way to see that could be to plot the MSD: 

![[MSD_wound.png]]
Should be more or less confined or at least follow the organism. Here you see the plot is not smooth. Could be a way to quantify the segmentation ... 

## Image annotation for CNN

I created labels in Napari using the contrast movie and randomly selecting 10 frames. 

The data can be found in :

```
C:\Users\nessl\Documents\M2\Lab2\placozoa_tracking\data\data_yapic
```

The repository is split in input (raw image) and target (labels)

I also added an augmenter function from stardist [example notebooks](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/blob/master/examples/2D/2_training.ipynb). I populated the dataset with 30 augmented images augmented (flipped, rotated, and intensity modified)

I tried to train the YAPIC model however the model only runs on [Linux](https://yapic.github.io/yapic/)... Will try to make it run on a virtual machine. 

## Comparisson of segmentation using performance metrics:

I want to compare the segmentation of Chan Vese and Otsu to my own annotation and compute: 
- Jaccard Index (IoU)
- F1 score
- % pixel "well" classified

### First step: segment the contrasted images with otsu:

![[placozoa_tracking/data/results/figures/otsu/contrast/trichoplax_area_time.png]]
We can now compare the two: 

![[placozoa_tracking/data/results/figures/compare/contrast/all_features.png]]

### Compare with annotated data
Compared Chan vese segmented image (1 slice) with the corresponding hand annotated image

![[jaccard.png]]

Next step is to do that for all slices I have for the two methods of segmentation and for all metrics.

## 14/10/2022 :

Meeting with Léo: segment the algea to correct for drif and be able to remove them from original image. 

### Computing the F1 score on the images segmented vs annotated

![[jaccard.png]]


### Displaying the intensity histogram as a function of time  to try and set a threshold 

![[animation_intensity_time.gif]]
I need to find a way to 'automatically' choose a threshold and reset the intensity histogram: 
- could be as a % of the max.
- as a function of the microscope

### Segmenting the algae

Because we have a time serie we can project all the time points together to increase the contrast of the image. Here is multiple ways to do so:

![[type_of_projection.png]]
We see that the mean projection removes the placozoa (moving) and leaves the static points (algea). From this we can invert the image and segment it

![[algea_detection.png]]
I used a Chan Vese algorithm of segmentation. 

From this we can remove from all the planes the algaes. The question is for moments when the animal overlaps with an algae... 

Also from this we can extract the coordinates of one algae and compute a drift correction( translation). 

All these results can be found in the notebook 'preprocess image'

A thing to threshold the image. It looks gaussianly distributed for all plans, the thing could be to remove stuff that are at $n*sd \; n>2$ to make sure to keep only the important information.
