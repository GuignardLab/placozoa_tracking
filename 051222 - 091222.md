Try and fix the correction for the new movie and work on presentation

## Team meeting LÃ©o:
- Plot the trajectory and color it by w/o area ratio
- Plot in x the frame number where the wound is seen and place crosses where there is a plane missing for the interpolation
- Apply the criteria for the correction on the raw image and correct a new image to avoid bias (avoid having to correct all frames depending on the previous)
- Replace the value corrected by an averag value not the previous value of the dataframe

## Trajectory

## Correction

We see way better results. 

## Segmentation optimization

There was a part of the segmentation code that checked that the background wa touching more the border than the organism.

If that condition wasn't met there was a np invert function. However this function created an image with negative values that made it impossible to label. Instead I used a np logical_not function that created true false image that could be labeled. 

Also I realized that there was a binary fill holes function that created huge objects on the image. I removed it and the results of the segmentation were better:

There are less spikes and with the correction we have an even better image.

## Plotting the missing frames

We see that the preprocessing allowed for more wound time. 

## Running the pipeline on new movies
