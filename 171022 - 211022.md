Better algea detection ![[algea_detection.png]]


### Automatic contrast enhancement

Follwing the idea I had last week, I decided to enhance the contrast by removing objects that were fare from the average intensity (the animal). It might not necessarly increase the signal to noise as it might also keep the algae but it might imrpove the contrast a bit. 

I thus removed all pixels that were not in $average \pm 2*\sigma$ 

![[contrast_cutoff.png]]
We see taht there is a small contrast increase as the distribution is more centered on the mean... 
Let's try the segmentation and compare it against the segmentation done on manually enhanced contrast: 

![[all_features_contrast.png]]
We see more flickering, so I plotted the gif annimating the "raw contrasted" image: 

![[animation_contrast_enhanced.gif]]
We see indeed a bit more contrast but we see more the algae wich might influence too much the segemntation and produce the "noise" in the area.

However if we succeed to remove the algae in this move it might be the optimal quality image...

Best try so far: 

![[algea_removal.png]]
The problem is that we need to remove the algea for each plane and only if there is nothing "above" it. I need to find a way to distinguish animal vs not animal
Other wise I can set an arbitrary value (close to the placozoa one) and then for the algae in the backgorund they will be removed either during the contrast enhancement or during the segmentation. 

# 18/10/2022: Automatic segmentation

I retried to sgment only the algae without having to manually set a threshold value. I got the following result:

![[algea_detection_automatic.png]]
I also used chan Vese algorithm but I removed the largest connected component (the animal). 

The removal becomes: 

![[algea_removal_automatic.png]]

More objects are removed. 

Another simpler idea: use a combination of masks on the image. We have the mask of the algae, the one of the organism, we can substract the 2 to get everything but the intersection and then we can apply this last mask on the raw image to correct it.

It gives that: 

![[algea_removal_automatic_proof_of_concept.png]]

We can apply the same process iteratively changing the animal mask and hopefully get a better raw image. 

When applied to a full image it gives: 

![[algea_removal_automatic_corrected_image.png]]
We see that for the 2 different time points different objects are removed depending on whether they appear on the mask or not. 

## Segmentation + plots

I segmented using Chan vese and obtained the follwing plot.

![[algae_removaltrichoplax_area_time.png]]

It is more clean than the previous results wich is explained by the the removal of the algae. It is still a bit noisy due to the fact that the removal doesn't deal well with algea that are touched by placozoa... 

I will try to increase the contrast of the algae movie and re segment to see of we get better results


![[placozoa_tracking/data/results/figures/compare/algae_removal/all_features_contrast.png]]
We see that the contrast enhancement did not really work... 

However, the algae removal increased the resolution of the movie getting close to manual contrast enhancement : 

![[placozoa_tracking/data/results/figures/compare/algae_removal/all_features.png]]

We can try instead of removing the pixels al the algae postion just change the value to a low background value to increase the contrast and "blend them" to the background. But it wil not deal with algaes close to the object...

# 19/10/2022

- I learned how to work on the lab workstation and connect to it

- I made new movies on the microscope:
	- single organisms moving around
	- wounds
	- wond + normal organism

Conditions: 

- Magnification: 10X
- 3 frames per second
- Total recording time 15 min
- Pixel size : 2.6 µm (reel pixel size 6µm on the camera and 4x binning)
- Wound: 15 of laser power for 2 seconds
- Size of wound: 333 pixels -> 200µm

Comparing segmentation and try contrast enhancement.
![[contrast_stretching_equalization.png]]
I tried 2 different contrast enhancements: first is contrast stretching and the second is histogram equalization. I only did this process on one plane as a proof of concept.

Team meeting andrea

Analyze and test contrast enhancement:

![[placozoa_tracking/data/results/figures/compare/auto_contrast/all_features_contrast.png]]

I took the images made on the 20/10/2022 and sgmented them and extacted features.

Something went wrong with the Histogram equalization....
